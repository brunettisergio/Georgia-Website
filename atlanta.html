				<p>
					<strong>Atlanta</strong> is the capital and most populous
					city of the U.S. state of Georgia. It is the seat of Fulton
					County, the most populous county in Georgia, although a
					portion of the city extends into neighboring DeKalb County.
					Classified as a suburban city, its income level is slightly
					higher compared to the rest of the state with a population
					reaching the 500,000 living within the city limits, it is
					the 8th most populous city in the Southeast and 38th most
					populous city in the United States according to the 2020
					U.S. census. Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian
					Mountains at an elevation of just over 1,000 feet (300 m)
					above sea level, its unique topography includes rolling
					hills, lush greenery, and the most dense urban tree coverage
					of any major city in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					Atlanta was originally founded in 1847 as the terminus of a
					major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the
					convergence point among several railroads, spurring its
					rapid growth. The largest was the Western and Atlantic
					Railroad, from which the name "Atlanta" is derived,
					signifying the city's growing reputation as a major hub of
					transportation.

					<h2>Sports</h2>
					<p>
						Sports in Atlanta has a rich history, including the
						oldest on-campus NCAA Division I football stadium, Bobby
						Dodd Stadium, built in 1913 by the students of Georgia
						Tech. Atlanta also played host to the second
						intercollegiate football game in the South, played
						between the A&M College of Alabama (now Auburn
						University) and the University of Georgia in Piedmont
						Park in 1892; this game is now called the Deep South's
						Oldest Rivalry. The city hosts college football's annual
						Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl and the Peachtree Road Race, the
						world's largest 10 km race.

					<p>
						Atlanta is in the midst of a cultural renaissance. The
						city's scene has long commanded respect, but within the
						last few years, Atlanta has arrived. Their hip-hop scene
						sets the standard for the industry. Their theaters are
						premiering some of the most-produced plays across the
						nation. Their dancers can be seen from Broadway to the
						Kennedy Center—and that's before we even get into our
						film and television industry. The Covid-19 pandemic
						presented innumerable challenges for working artists,
						but they still gave their all and solidified Atlanta's
						position as a cultural destination.
					</p>
					<p>
						From immersive, virtual reality experiences to Zoom
						poetry slams, artists entertained us and articulated our
						experiences during a harrowing global pandemic and
						heart-wrenching racial reckoning. Some artists found it
						impossible to create in the midst of unrest, but others
						experienced a fury of inspiration. Either way,
						everything that bubbled up in them—and in us—is coming
						forth now. The city will benefit from the art emerging
						from this moment in time for decades to come, yet many
						of the city's artists and artistic institutions have
						struggled to re-engage longtime patrons, much less
						cultivate new ones.

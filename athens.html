					Athens, officially Athens-Clarke County, is a consolidated
					city-county and college town in the U.S. state of Georgia.
					Athens lies about 70 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta,
					and is a satellite city of the capital. The University of
					Georgia, the state's flagship public university and an R1
					research institution, is in Athens and contributed to its
					initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year,
					the original City of Athens abandoned its charter to form a
					unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly
					as Athens-Clarke County.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clarke County was established in 1801 and named after Elijah
					Clarke, a Revolutionary War hero, and Athens was established
					as a town in 1805. Athens is the sixth-largest urban city in
					Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens metropolitan
					area, which had a 2020 population of 215,415, according to
					the U.S. Census Bureau. its average income level is slightly
					higher than the state of Georgia.

						The University of Georgia (UGA) is a public land-grant
						research university with its main campus in Athens,
						Georgia. Chartered in 1785, it is one of the oldest
						public universities in the United States. It is the
						flagship school of the University System of Georgia.
						Notable alumni and attendees include current and former
						members of the United States Senate, members of the
						United States House of Representatives, federal judges,
						Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, MacArthur Fellows
						(the "Genius Grant") winners, as well as Pulitzer Prize
						winners, a United States Poet Laureate, Emmy Award
						winners, Grammy Award winners, and multiple Super Bowl
						champions.
					</p>
					<p>
						The university has seventeen schools and colleges. In
						addition to the colleges and schools, the university is
						home to the UGA/Medical College of Georgia Medical
						Partnership that provides education leading to the
						Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the University of
						Georgia as well as extensive facilities for medically
						related education and research.

					<p>
						Since last fall, visitors to Athens have had a new
						reason to say “Cheers!” at the quintessential college
						town's collection of craft breweries. Thanks to changes
						in Georgia's alcohol regulations, breweries (and
						distilleries across the state, too) can now sell their
						suds straight from the source — no more being relegated
						to shopping for craft beers at wholesale distribution
						sites.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, there's never been a better time to embark on
						some beer tasting — and grab a six-pack to go — in one
						of the South's edgiest formerly antebellum towns. The
						Rye Pale Ale has been a favorite since it took home a
						gold medal at the American Beer Festival in Denver back
						in 2002. In fact, that single beer was the impetus for
						the brewmasters to open a brick-and-mortar outfit a few
						years later in 2008 in Athens's artsy warehouse
						district.
